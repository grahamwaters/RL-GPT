RL-GPT: Reinforcement Learning Powered LLM Development via GPT-4 and OpenAI experimentation
Welcome to RL-GPT, a research project exploring the use of reinforcement learning to train a GPT-4 language model. This project is currently being developed by Graham Waters, and it is based on the latest advancements in deep learning and natural language processing, OpenAI GPT-4, RL algorithms on hugging-face and LLM research. 

What is RL-GPT?
RL-GPT is an experimental project that aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of language model training by using reinforcement learning. In this project, we will train a hypothetical version of the GPT series of language models, GPT-4, using RL techniques to optimize its performance.

How to use RL-GPT?
Currently, RL-GPT is in its early development stages and is not yet available for general use. However, we plan to release the code and models once we have achieved meaningful results.
